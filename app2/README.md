# RelationalAI UX / Tools Repository

This repository contains the beginning framework for the UX team's work
on reactive Delve notebooks. It launches an Express-based web server using
a simple server-side page templating engine, and sets up a webpack build
for the client which is demonstrated through the creation of a simple custom 
element.
